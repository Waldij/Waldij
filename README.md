### Hey! :wave: 

I'm Vladislav. And I'm still studying at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology. 
Since childhood, I love to automate everything, even once with the team we won the European competition in robotics.

- I am a QA Automation intern at [Align Technology inc.](https://www.aligntech.com/)
- I usually write in Python, sometimes I use something like C# or JS.
- In my free time, I compose music :musical_note: (mostly around the rock or metal genre :guitar:)

### My stack of technologies:

Programming languages: Python, Ð¡#

Frameworks and other tools: Flask(flasgger), Git (Bitbucket), JIRA, Bamboo, Docker

QA: Selenium, Behave, Postman, Splunk, JIRA + tm4j, Catchpoint

Since we use bitbucket at my current job, my activity on github is not very high.
